<!-- Learning Journey -->
As a self-learner and newbie in web development, this project has been an invaluable learning experience for me. Working on it provided me with insights into real-world application development and helped me understand how to build a responsive user interface.

<!-- Key Learning Points: -->
1. Responsive Design: I aimed to recreate the exact Figma design into a responsive website. Although I have successfully created a desktop view, I am still working on perfecting the mobile view. Understanding media queries and breakpoints for different devices has been a crucial part of this process.
2. Mistakes & Improvements: I acknowledge that I made some mistakes along the way, but every error has been an opportunity to learn and improve. I now realize the importance of testing design on multiple screen sizes and adjusting elements accordingly.
3. Exploring Technologies: I am continuously exploring and experimenting with new technologies, tools, and best practices in web development. My goal is to keep refining this project until I achieve a fully responsive, functional, and polished web application.

Though I haven't yet completed the mobile view in second wwebpage , I am determined to keep learning, fixing errors, and iterating on my designs to improve the user experience on all device sizes.
